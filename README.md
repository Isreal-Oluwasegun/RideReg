# LaneWatch - Neural Vehicle Type Classifier for Law Enforcement

**LaneWatch** is a deep learning-powered image classifier that identifies vehicle types â€” specifically distinguishing between **CNG vehicles** and **buses** â€” using computer vision. Built with future integration in mind (e.g. **live video feeds**, **traffic enforcement**, and **smart city AI systems**), LaneWatch helps automate rule enforcement and environmental compliance in urban mobility.

## Key Features

- **Binary Image Classification** - CNG vs Bus  
- **Law Enforcement Use Case** - Ideal for surveillance camera feeds  
- **Built for Extensibility** - Future-ready for live video input & additional vehicle classes  
- **Streamlit Frontend** - Upload images & receive instant classification  
- **Model Explainability** - Ready for integration with Grad-CAM & attention visualization

---

## Use Cases

- **Law Enforcement**: Monitor restricted lanes and catch violations (e.g. non-CNGs in CNG-only lanes)
- **Environmental Compliance**: Classify cleaner-energy vehicles on the road
- **Transit Analytics**: Track proportions of buses vs small-scale public vehicles
- **Smart City Infrastructure**: Feed traffic insights into central dashboards

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV / PIL
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- Matplotlib & Scikit-learn (for evaluation)
